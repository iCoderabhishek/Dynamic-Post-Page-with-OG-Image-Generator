## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dynamic-Post-Page-with-OG-Image-Generator.git
   cd dynamic-og
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```

### Project Structure

- **`/components`**: Reusable React components used throughout the application.

### How It Works

1. **Submit Post**: Use the form on the homepage to submit a title, content, and an image.
